            Hub Maker provides JupyterHubs for teaching professionals. No matter if your students are professionals, high school or university students. It allows you to start with the content of your course on day one instead of having to get everyone setup first.</p>

            <p>Based on the widely used, popular and open-source <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> technology all your students need is a web browser. While you could set it up yourself, we offer you peace of mind and our experience in operating these powerful tools reliably.</p>
