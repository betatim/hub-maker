            Hub Hero for enterprise let's you deploy JupyterHubs that are individually configured. Ideal if some of your staff need hubs for training, or a temporary one for a hackathon or one to share work with clients.</p>
            <p>Each JupyterHub's environment can be fully customised. The platform supports Python, R Studio, C++ out of the box, as well as any of the over 60 languages supported by Jupyter.</p>
            <p>Based on the widely used, popular and open-source <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> technology all your students need is a web browser. While you could set it up yourself, we offer you peace of mind and our experience in operating these powerful tools reliably.</p>
            <p>This offers is ideal for universities, teaching institutions and large enterprises. For details please email <a href="mailto:enterprisehub@wildtreetech.com">enterprisehub@wildtreetech.com</a>.

          <p>Hub Hero for enterprise can be fully customised to your needs. For a fully managed service we operate deployments on Google's cloud. This is not always possible because of privacy and confidentiality, or maybe you already have your own cloud. We can work with your in-house team. All the technology is open-source which means you will not end up locked in to proprietary software. You could do it all yourself. We provide the expertise and safety net of having done this before.</p>

          <p>We would love to hear from you. We believe deployments at the scale of a whole organisation require an excellent personal relationship and deep understanding of your needs. Let's start that relationship now via a short email to agree when we can meet: <a href="mailto:enterprisehub@wildtreetech.com">enterprisehub@wildtreetech.com</a></p>
