These projects include <a href="http://mybinder.org">mybinder.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize">scikit-optimize</a>.</p>

          <p>By using open source products our clients are building on solid foundation, benefit from the development of new ideas, and are not locked in to a particular vendor.</p>
