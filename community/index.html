        <h2>Community install</h2>
        <p>Often the hardest part is taking the first step. Let us get you pointed in the right direction. For a flat one-time fee of $150 we will install a state of the art multi-user Jupyter notebook server on your hardware or in the cloud for you. Please note that you will have to pay for the hosting and that this option is completely self-support after the initial install. You could do it all yourself or let us provide the expertise and safety net of having done this before.</p>

            The community install gives you a state of the art JupyterHub server that lets you focus on teaching instead of being tech support for your students. As part of this package we will configure your JupyterHub with HTTPS encryption, a simple user account management solution and we will advise you on the appropriate computing power for your course.
          </p>
          <p>
            This offer is ideal for courses up to about 30 students and teachers who are comfortable following guides that use the command-line to perform occasional administrative tasks. If you have more questions please email <a href="mailto:hello@hubhero.net">hello@hubhero.net</a> or <a href="#ordernow">order your community install now</a>.

            You will need to obtain a machine that we can install your JupyterHub on. This can be hardware you already have or a virtual machine you rent from a cloud provider. We recommend <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> as simple and reliable cloud hoster available in many jurisdictions. Reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@hubhero.net">hello@hubhero.net</a> if you'd like to be referred to Digital Ocean and receive $100 in free credits.
          </p>
          <p>
            For us to be able to do our work the machine has to be accessible by ssh over the internet and run <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu 18.04.</a>

          <p>This option is completely self-support after the initial install. The global Jupyter community is excellent at helping newcomers and one correctly configured a JupyterHub requires little maintenance. If you should ever get stuck or need an additional pair of hands reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@hubhero.net">hello@hubhero.net</a> to discuss additional support options based on a preferred hourly rate for existing customers.
