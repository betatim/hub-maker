        <h2>Self-hosted</h2>
        <p>Our most popular option. This options is ideal for courses of up to 30 students. It does not require complex cloud setups or much ongoing maintenance. For a flat one-time fee of $150 (excl tax) we will install a professionally configured multi-user Jupyter notebook server on a server you already own or one you rent from a cloud provider. Please note that you will have to pay for the hosting and that this option is completely self-support after the initial install. Curious about what it will look like or not quite sure this is for you? <a href="/trial">Start your free trial</a>.</p>

            Please note that you will need to obtain a machine that we can install your JupyterHub on. This can be hardware you already have or a virtual machine you rent from a cloud provider. As part of our self-managed offer we can advise you on an appropriately sized machine. We recommend <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> as a simple and reliable cloud hoster available in a jurisdictions near you (important for data protection). Reach out to <a href="mailto:tim@hubhero.net">tim@hubhero.net</a> if you'd like to be referred to Digital Ocean and receive $100 in free credits.
          </p>
          <p>
            For us to be able to do our work the machine has to be accessible by ssh over the internet and run <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu 18.04</a>.
